### Step 1


* Create a repository for your ground truth data. Click on the [**Use this Template**](/../../generate) button.
* Save your data to the repository. Your data should be stored in the **Data folder**. See the Organization of folders and files in the Repo <b>[ðŸ—€](#myfootnote1)</b> 

### Step 2

* Metadata is necessary to ensure that your repository is documented correctly. It is best to use the <a href="https://tboenig.github.io/gt-metadata/document-your-gt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metadata</a> form to record the metadata.


### Step 3

* The template contains tools that automatically create specific web pages from the stored metadata and ground truth data. You can publish these as GitHub pages. 
   -  First, start the [analysis workflow](/../../actions/workflows/gtrepo.yml) and then adjust the GitHub [page setting](/../../settings/pages). Select the [gh-pages branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to do this. 


### Step 4


* Customize the new readme file. 
* In the `<div id="extent">` section, you can additions to the README file

You can find the old readme file in the readme folder.

**Images**: keep images in the same directory as the textual transcription (eg. GT-PAGE).

 The structure of the repo is the following:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ METADATA.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE.md
â””â”€â”€ data
      â””â”€â”€ document_title or identifer
          â”œâ”€â”€ GT-PAGE
          â””â”€â”€ GT-LINE
            
           

```
